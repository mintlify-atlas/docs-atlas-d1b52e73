## What are Events?

Events in SuprSend represent user actions or occurrences in your application that you want to track. Events can trigger automated workflows, update user properties, and provide valuable insights into user behavior.

<Tip>
Events are the bridge between user actions in your app and automated notifications. Track what users do, then use that data to send timely, relevant messages.
</Tip>

## Event Anatomy

Every event has three core components:

1. **distinct_id**: The unique identifier of the user performing the action
2. **event_name**: A descriptive name for the event (e.g., "purchase_completed", "trial_started")
3. **properties**: Additional data about the event (optional)

```python
from suprsend import Event

event = Event(
    distinct_id="user-123",           # Who performed the action
    event_name="purchase_completed",  # What action occurred
    properties={                       # Additional context
        "order_id": "ORD-789",
        "amount": 99.99,
        "currency": "USD",
        "items": ["Product A", "Product B"]
    }
)
```

## Event Names

Event names should be descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.

### Naming Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use snake_case" icon="snake">
    `user_signed_up`, `purchase_completed`, `trial_expired`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    `checkout_completed` is better than just `checkout`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Past Tense" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    `order_placed` instead of `place_order`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stay Consistent" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Pick a convention and stick with it across your app
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Reserved Event Names

SuprSend reserves certain event names for internal use:

```python
# Reserved events (do not use these names)
"$identify"                    # User identification
"$notification_delivered"      # Notification tracking
"$notification_dismiss"        # Notification dismissed
"$notification_clicked"        # Notification clicked
"$app_launched"               # App opened
"$user_login"                 # User logged in
"$user_logout"                # User logged out
```

<Warning>
Event names starting with `$` or `ss_` are reserved by SuprSend and cannot be used for custom events. The SDK will raise an `InputValueError` if you try to use them.
</Warning>

See implementation: `/home/daytona/workspace/source/src/suprsend/event.py:18-22`

## Event Properties

Properties provide additional context about the event. They can be any JSON-serializable data.

### Property Examples

```python
# E-commerce event
Event(
    distinct_id="user-123",
    event_name="product_viewed",
    properties={
        "product_id": "PROD-456",
        "product_name": "Wireless Headphones",
        "category": "Electronics",
        "price": 129.99,
        "currency": "USD",
        "in_stock": True
    }
)

# User engagement event
Event(
    distinct_id="user-123",
    event_name="video_watched",
    properties={
        "video_id": "VID-789",
        "title": "Getting Started Tutorial",
        "duration_seconds": 180,
        "completion_rate": 0.85,
        "quality": "1080p"
    }
)

# Subscription event
Event(
    distinct_id="user-123",
    event_name="subscription_upgraded",
    properties={
        "old_plan": "basic",
        "new_plan": "premium",
        "monthly_price": 29.99,
        "billing_cycle": "monthly",
        "next_billing_date": "2024-03-01"
    }
)
```

### Nested Properties

Properties can include nested objects and arrays:

```python
Event(
    distinct_id="user-123",
    event_name="order_completed",
    properties={
        "order_id": "ORD-789",
        "total": 299.99,
        "shipping_address": {
            "street": "123 Main St",
            "city": "San Francisco",
            "state": "CA",
            "zip": "94105",
            "country": "US"
        },
        "items": [
            {
                "product_id": "PROD-1",
                "name": "Product A",
                "quantity": 2,
                "price": 99.99
            },
            {
                "product_id": "PROD-2",
                "name": "Product B",
                "quantity": 1,
                "price": 100.01
            }
        ]
    }
)
```

## Tracking Events

### Basic Event Tracking

```python
from suprsend import Suprsend, Event

# Initialize client
supr_client = Suprsend("your_workspace_key", "your_workspace_secret")

# Create event
event = Event(
    distinct_id="user-123",
    event_name="purchase_completed",
    properties={
        "order_id": "ORD-789",
        "amount": 99.99,
        "items_count": 3
    }
)

# Track the event
response = supr_client.track_event(event)
print(response)
```

### Response Structure

Successful response:
```python
{
    "success": True,
    "status": "success",
    "status_code": 202,
    "message": "message_id_here",
    "raw_response": {...}
}
```

Error response:
```python
{
    "success": False,
    "status": "fail",
    "status_code": 400,  # or 500
    "message": "Error description",
    "raw_response": {...}
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Idempotency Key

Prevent duplicate event tracking by using an idempotency key:

```python
event = Event(
    distinct_id="user-123",
    event_name="purchase_completed",
    properties={...},
    idempotency_key="order-789-event"  # Max 64 chars
)

response = supr_client.track_event(event)
```

<Info>
SuprSend will skip processing events with the same idempotency key for 24 hours after the first event.
</Info>

### Multi-Tenant Support

Track events for specific tenants:

```python
event = Event(
    distinct_id="user-123",
    event_name="purchase_completed",
    properties={...},
    tenant_id="tenant-abc"
)
```

### Brand ID

Associate events with specific brands:

```python
event = Event(
    distinct_id="user-123",
    event_name="purchase_completed",
    properties={...},
    brand_id="brand-xyz"
)
```

### Adding Attachments

Attach files to events (useful for receipts, invoices, etc.):

```python
event = Event(
    distinct_id="user-123",
    event_name="invoice_generated",
    properties={"invoice_id": "INV-123"}
)

# Add attachment
event.add_attachment("/path/to/invoice.pdf")
event.add_attachment("/path/to/receipt.pdf", file_name="Receipt.pdf")

response = supr_client.track_event(event)
```

## Bulk Event Tracking

For tracking multiple events efficiently, use the bulk API:

```python
from suprsend import Event

# Create bulk instance
bulk_ins = supr_client.bulk_events.new_instance()

# Create multiple events
e1 = Event("user-1", "page_viewed", {"page": "/home"})
e2 = Event("user-2", "button_clicked", {"button": "signup"})
e3 = Event("user-3", "form_submitted", {"form": "contact"})

# Append events
bulk_ins.append(e1, e2, e3)
# Or append individually
# bulk_ins.append(e1)
# bulk_ins.append(e2)

# Track all events
response = bulk_ins.trigger()
print(response)
```

<Note>
- The SDK automatically chunks requests based on size limits (max 800KB per request)
- Each chunk is sent as a separate API call
- Maximum 100 events per bulk API call
</Note>

See constants: `/home/daytona/workspace/source/src/suprsend/constants.py:17`

## Event Metadata

SuprSend automatically adds metadata to each event:

```python
{
    "$insert_id": "uuid-v4-here",           # Unique event ID
    "$time": 1706543210000,                 # Unix timestamp in milliseconds
    "env": "your_workspace_key",           # Workspace identifier
    "properties": {
        "$ss_sdk_version": "suprsend-py-sdk/version",  # SDK version
        # ... your custom properties
    }
}
```

See implementation: `/home/daytona/workspace/source/src/suprsend/event.py:81-110`

## Event Use Cases

### Triggering Automated Workflows

Events can trigger workflows automatically when configured in the SuprSend dashboard:

```python
# Track cart abandonment
event = Event(
    distinct_id="user-123",
    event_name="cart_abandoned",
    properties={
        "cart_value": 149.99,
        "items_count": 3,
        "abandoned_at": "2024-02-28T10:30:00Z"
    }
)
supr_client.track_event(event)

# SuprSend can automatically trigger:
# - Immediate reminder email
# - Follow-up email after 24 hours
# - Final reminder with discount code after 48 hours
```

### User Segmentation

Use events to segment users based on behavior:

```python
# Track feature usage
Event("user-123", "feature_used", {"feature": "advanced_analytics"})
Event("user-123", "export_data", {"format": "csv", "rows": 10000})

# Use these events to:
# - Identify power users
# - Trigger feature-specific tips
# - Offer relevant upgrades
```

### Analytics and Reporting

Track key metrics for business intelligence:

```python
# Revenue events
Event("user-123", "purchase_completed", {"revenue": 99.99, "plan": "premium"})
Event("user-456", "subscription_renewed", {"mrr": 29.99, "months": 12})

# Engagement events
Event("user-789", "daily_active_user", {"session_duration": 1800})
Event("user-101", "feature_adoption", {"feature": "ai_assistant"})
```

## Size Limitations

<Warning>
A single event body must not exceed **800KB** (819,200 bytes). If exceeded, the SDK will raise an `InputValueError`.
</Warning>

The SDK validates event size before sending. See implementation: `/home/daytona/workspace/source/src/suprsend/utils.py:61`

### Property Naming Conventions

```python
# Good: Clear, descriptive property names
{
    "product_id": "PROD-123",
    "product_name": "Wireless Mouse",
    "price_usd": 29.99,
    "quantity": 2,
    "category": "Electronics"
}

# Avoid: Vague or inconsistent names
{
    "id": "PROD-123",        # Which ID?
    "name": "Wireless Mouse", # Name of what?
    "price": 29.99,           # What currency?
    "qty": 2,                 # Abbreviation
    "cat": "Electronics"      # Unclear abbreviation
}
```

## Common Event Patterns

### E-commerce

```python
# Product browsing
Event(distinct_id, "product_viewed", {"product_id", "category"})
Event(distinct_id, "product_added_to_cart", {"product_id", "price"})
Event(distinct_id, "cart_viewed", {"cart_value", "items_count"})
Event(distinct_id, "checkout_started", {"cart_value"})
Event(distinct_id, "payment_info_entered", {"payment_method"})
Event(distinct_id, "order_completed", {"order_id", "total", "items"})
```

### SaaS Application

```python
# User lifecycle
Event(distinct_id, "user_signed_up", {"source", "plan"})
Event(distinct_id, "trial_started", {"trial_days"})
Event(distinct_id, "onboarding_completed", {"steps_completed"})
Event(distinct_id, "subscription_created", {"plan", "price"})
Event(distinct_id, "feature_used", {"feature_name", "usage_count"})
Event(distinct_id, "subscription_cancelled", {"reason", "feedback"})
```

### Content Platform

```python
# Content engagement
Event(distinct_id, "content_viewed", {"content_id", "type"})
Event(distinct_id, "video_started", {"video_id", "duration"})
Event(distinct_id, "video_completed", {"video_id", "watch_time"})
Event(distinct_id, "article_read", {"article_id", "read_percentage"})
Event(distinct_id, "content_shared", {"content_id", "platform"})
Event(distinct_id, "comment_posted", {"content_id", "comment_length"})
```

## Validation

The SDK performs automatic validation before sending events:

- **distinct_id**: Must be a non-empty string
- **event_name**: Must be a non-empty string, not reserved
- **properties**: Must be a dictionary (if provided)
- **Size**: Total event size must not exceed 800KB
