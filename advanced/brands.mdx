Brands in SuprSend allow you to white-label notifications and customize the sender identity for different products, sub-brands, or customer segments.

## Overview

Brands enable you to:

- Customize sender names and email addresses
- Use different logos and brand colors
- Support white-labeling for multi-product offerings
- Maintain consistent branding across channels

## BrandsApi class

Access brand operations through the `supr_client.brands` property:

```python
from suprsend import Suprsend

supr_client = Suprsend("workspace_key", "workspace_secret")
brands_api = supr_client.brands
```

## List brands

Retrieve all brands with pagination:

```python
# Get first 20 brands
response = supr_client.brands.list()

# Get brands with custom pagination
response = supr_client.brands.list(limit=50, offset=0)
```

**Parameters:**
- `limit` (int, optional): Number of brands to return (1-1000, default: 20)
- `offset` (int, optional): Number of brands to skip (default: 0)

## Get brand details

Retrieve information about a specific brand:

```python
brand_id = "primary-brand"
response = supr_client.brands.get(brand_id)
```

**Parameters:**
- `brand_id` (str, required): Unique identifier for the brand

## Create or update brand

Create a new brand or update an existing one:

```python
brand_id = "primary-brand"
brand_payload = {
    "brand_name": "Acme Products",
    "from_name": "Acme Team",
    "from_email": "notifications@acme.com",
    "reply_to_email": "support@acme.com",
    "logo_url": "https://acme.com/logo.png",
    "primary_color": "#FF5733"
}

response = supr_client.brands.upsert(brand_id, brand_payload)
```

**Parameters:**
- `brand_id` (str, required): Unique identifier for the brand
- `brand_payload` (dict, required): Brand configuration data

<Note>
Brand payload fields may vary based on your SuprSend workspace configuration. Check with your SuprSend dashboard for available options.
</Note>

## Using brands with workflows

Specify a brand when triggering workflows:

```python
from suprsend import WorkflowTriggerRequest

wf = WorkflowTriggerRequest(
    body={
        "workflow": "order_confirmation",
        "recipients": [{"distinct_id": "user123"}],
        "data": {"order_id": "12345"}
    },
    brand_id="primary-brand"
)

response = supr_client.workflows.trigger(wf)
```

## Using brands with events

Track events associated with a brand:

```python
from suprsend import Event

event = Event(
    distinct_id="user123",
    event_name="product_viewed",
    properties={"product_id": "SKU-789"},
    brand_id="primary-brand"
)

response = supr_client.track_event(event)
```

## Multi-brand workflow example

Here's an example of using different brands for different products:

```python
from suprsend import WorkflowTriggerRequest

# Brand for Product A
wf_product_a = WorkflowTriggerRequest(
    body={
        "workflow": "welcome",
        "recipients": [{"distinct_id": "user123"}]
    },
    brand_id="product-a-brand"
)
supr_client.workflows.trigger(wf_product_a)

# Brand for Product B
wf_product_b = WorkflowTriggerRequest(
    body={
        "workflow": "welcome",
        "recipients": [{"distinct_id": "user456"}]
    },
    brand_id="product-b-brand"
)
supr_client.workflows.trigger(wf_product_b)
```

## Combining tenants and brands

You can use both `tenant_id` and `brand_id` together:

```python
from suprsend import WorkflowTriggerRequest

wf = WorkflowTriggerRequest(
    body={
        "workflow": "invoice_generated",
        "recipients": [{"distinct_id": "user123"}]
    },
    tenant_id="enterprise-org-123",
    brand_id="enterprise-brand"
)

response = supr_client.workflows.trigger(wf)
```

## Error handling

```python
from suprsend import SuprsendAPIException

try:
    response = supr_client.brands.get("non-existent-brand")
except SuprsendAPIException as e:
    print(f"API error: {e.status_code} - {e.message}")
```
