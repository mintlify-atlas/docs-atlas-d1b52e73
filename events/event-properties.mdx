## Overview

Event properties provide additional context and metadata about user actions. Understanding how to structure properties and which event names are reserved is crucial for effective event tracking.

## Event Properties

Properties are passed as a dictionary when creating an event:

```python
from suprsend import Event

event = Event(
    distinct_id="user_123",
    event_name="product_purchased",
    properties={
        "product_id": "prod_456",
        "product_name": "Premium Subscription",
        "price": 99.99,
        "currency": "USD",
        "category": "subscription",
        "billing_cycle": "monthly"
    }
)
```

### Property Types

Event properties support various data types:

  <Accordion title="String">
    ```python
    properties = {
        "product_name": "Premium Plan",
        "category": "subscription"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Number">
    ```python
    properties = {
        "price": 99.99,
        "quantity": 2,
        "discount_percent": 15
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Boolean">
    ```python
    properties = {
        "is_first_purchase": True,
        "has_coupon": False
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Lists">
    ```python
    properties = {
        "tags": ["premium", "annual"],
        "features": ["analytics", "api_access", "priority_support"]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Nested Objects">
    ```python
    properties = {
        "billing_address": {
            "city": "San Francisco",
            "state": "CA",
            "country": "USA",
            "postal_code": "94105"
        }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reserved Event Names

SuprSend reserves certain event names for system-level tracking. These events are automatically tracked by SuprSend SDKs and should not be used for custom events.

### System Reserved Events

<Warning>
  Do not use these event names for custom events. They are reserved for SuprSend internal tracking.
</Warning>

| Event Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `$identify` | User identification and profile updates |
| `$notification_delivered` | Notification successfully delivered to user |
| `$notification_dismiss` | User dismissed a notification |
| `$notification_clicked` | User clicked on a notification |
| `$app_launched` | User opened/launched the application |
| `$user_login` | User logged into the application |
| `$user_logout` | User logged out of the application |

### Event Name Restrictions

Event names with certain prefixes are reserved by SuprSend:

<CodeGroup>
```python Reserved Prefixes (Not Allowed)
# Events starting with $ (except reserved events above)
event = Event("user_123", "$custom_event")  # ❌ Not allowed

# Events starting with ss_
event = Event("user_123", "ss_custom_event")  # ❌ Not allowed
```

```python Valid Custom Events
# Use descriptive names without reserved prefixes
event = Event("user_123", "product_purchased")  # ✅ Allowed
event = Event("user_123", "checkout_completed")  # ✅ Allowed
event = Event("user_123", "user_registered")    # ✅ Allowed
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Event names are case-sensitive. The prefix check looks at the first 3 characters in lowercase.
</Info>

## Special Properties

Certain property names have special meaning in SuprSend:

### Attachments Property

The `$attachments` property is automatically managed when using the `add_attachment()` method:

```python
event = Event("user_123", "invoice_generated")

# This automatically adds to properties["$attachments"]
event.add_attachment("/path/to/invoice.pdf")

# The event properties now contain:
# {
#     "$attachments": [
#         {
#             "filename": "invoice.pdf",
#             "content_type": "application/pdf",
#             "data": "base64_encoded_content"
#         }
#     ]
# }
```

<Warning>
  Do not manually modify the `$attachments` property. Use the `add_attachment()` method instead.
</Warning>

### SDK Version Property

SuprSend automatically adds the SDK version to all events:

```python
# Automatically added by SDK
properties["$ss_sdk_version"] = "suprsend/0.x.x;python"
```

## Event Metadata

In addition to custom properties, SuprSend automatically adds metadata to each event:

| Field | Description | Type |
|-------|-------------|------|
| `$insert_id` | Unique identifier for the event | UUID string |
| `$time` | Timestamp when the event was created | Unix timestamp (milliseconds) |
| `event` | The event name | String |
| `distinct_id` | User identifier | String |
| `env` | Workspace key | String |
| `$idempotency_key` | Optional deduplication key | String (if provided) |
| `tenant_id` | Optional tenant identifier | String (if provided) |
| `brand_id` | Optional brand identifier | String (if provided) |

## Event Size Limits

Events have size restrictions to ensure optimal performance:

<Note>
  Single events must not exceed 100 KB in size. This includes the event name, properties, and all metadata.
</Note>

If an event exceeds the size limit, you'll receive an error:

```python
from suprsend import Event, InputValueError

try:
    event = Event(
        "user_123",
        "large_event",
        properties={"data": "very large content..."}
    )
    response = supr_client.track_event(event)
except InputValueError as e:
    print(f"Event size too big: {e}")
    # Output: "Event size too big - 150000 Bytes, must not cross 100 KB"
```

  <Card title="Use Snake Case" icon="snake">
    Name properties using snake_case for consistency:

## Example: E-commerce Event

```python
from suprsend import Suprsend, Event

supr_client = Suprsend("workspace_key", "workspace_secret")

# Well-structured e-commerce event
event = Event(
    distinct_id="user_123",
    event_name="order_completed",
    properties={
        # Order details
        "order_id": "ord_456",
        "order_total": 249.97,
        "currency": "USD",
        "items_count": 3,
        
        # Product information
        "product_ids": ["prod_1", "prod_2", "prod_3"],
        "product_categories": ["electronics", "accessories"],
        
        # Transaction details
        "payment_method": "credit_card",
        "shipping_method": "express",
        "discount_code": "SAVE20",
        "discount_amount": 50.00,
        
        # User context
        "is_first_purchase": True,
        "user_tier": "premium",
        
        # Location
        "shipping_country": "USA",
        "shipping_state": "CA"
    },
    idempotency_key="order_456_completed"
)

response = supr_client.track_event(event)
```

## Validation

The SDK validates event properties before sending:

```python
from suprsend import Event, InputValueError

try:
    # Invalid: properties must be a dictionary
    event = Event(
        "user_123",
        "invalid_event",
        properties="not a dict"  # ❌ Error
    )
    supr_client.track_event(event)
except InputValueError as e:
    print(f"Validation error: {e}")
```
