## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of triggering a workflow:

```python
from suprsend import Suprsend, WorkflowTriggerRequest

# Initialize SDK
supr_client = Suprsend("your_workspace_key", "your_workspace_secret")

# Trigger a workflow
wf = WorkflowTriggerRequest(
    body={
        "workflow": "purchase-made",
        "recipients": [
            {
                "distinct_id": "user_123",
                "$email": ["user@example.com"],
            }
        ],
        "data": {
            "first_name": "John",
            "order_id": "#12345",
        }
    }
)

response = supr_client.workflows.trigger(wf)
print(response)
```
